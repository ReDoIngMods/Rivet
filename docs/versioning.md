# Rivet versioning

Rivet follows Thunderstore-style semantic versioning.

Each release of Rivet will have a version number in the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, where:
- `MAJOR`: Incremented for significant changes or overhauls that may break compatibility.
- `MINOR`: Incremented for new features or improvements that are backward compatible.
- `PATCH`: Incremented for bug fixes and minor changes that do not affect compatibility.

Rivet's versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) principles and matches Thunderstore's `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` convention.
